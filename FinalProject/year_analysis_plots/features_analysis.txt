 //Samples_per_year
 The number of samples per year is heavily biased. The samples before ~1950-60 are nonexistent, that's why further analysis will drop these first years.
 
 //Acousticness
 Most of the song are not very acoustic
 
 //Artist_hotttnesss
 Thankfully, we can see a correlation between the artist hotness and the song hotness. The distribution also seems to have more "hot" artists recently, which seems correct.
 
 //Danceability
 We can't say much, except that it seems centered around 0.5
 
 //Duration
 The mean is around 250s. The best (and worst) songs are really close to this value, but their distribution is probably the same as with the other hotness values, it's just that there are fewer samples. We can see a jump from a ~200s center to the ~250s center after the 1960s.
 
 //Duration_ms
 Same (remove I guess?)
 
 //Energy
 Same as with duration, we see a shift after the 1960s, after which the songs become more energetic
