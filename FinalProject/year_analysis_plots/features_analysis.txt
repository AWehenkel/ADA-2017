 //Samples_per_year
 The number of samples per year is heavily biased. The samples before ~1950-60 are nonexistent, that's why further analysis will drop these first years.
 
 //Acousticness
 Most of the song are not very acoustic today. The median acousticness seems to decrease with the years, especially after the 70s.
 
 //Artist_hotttnesss
 Thankfully, we can see a correlation between the artist hotness and the song hotness. The distribution also seems to less centered around 0.5 in the recent years.
 
 //Danceability
 We can't say much, except that it seems centered around 0.5
 
 //Duration
 The median is around 250s. The best (and worst) songs are really close to this value, but their distribution is probably the same as with the other hotness values, it's just that there are fewer samples. We can see a jump from a ~200s center to the ~250s center after the 1960s.
 
 //Duration_ms
 Same (remove I guess?)
 
 //Energy
 Same as with duration, we see a shift decade by decade, where the songs become more energetic
 
 //Instrumentalness
 Nothing much to say, except that the songs (at least the ones chosen by the MSD) were never instrumental.
 
 //Liveness
 The distribution stays the same
 
 //Loudness 
 The songs get louder during the 90s and 00s. The top songs seem to be the the louder.
 
 //Speechiness
 Same as instrumentalness
 
 //Tempo
 The tempo distribution stays the same throughout the years.
 
 //Valence
 The valence gets "worse" through the decades and the best songs stay around the 0.5 value
