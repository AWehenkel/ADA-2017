However, the duration hasn't increased since, probably because the artists and public feel that the current mean duration is the most optimal one.\n",

    "## Analysis\n",
    "The analysis will be done by decade, as otherwise the values per year jump a lot, and grouping by decade helps to visualize better the evolution of the features (their tendency). To avoid cluttering the notebook, the plots have been saved and examined on the disk (they are also available on the github repository).\n",

    "### Features\n",
    "First off, the features don't seem to influence the song hotness at all (except for the artist hotness obviously), which is a bit of a letdown. The median for each song hotness bin seems to be around the same value, and the distributions the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evolution\n",
    "There are some evolutions through the years / decades though:\n",
    "- The acousticness seems to decrease throughout the years, and the mean acousticness is quite low overall.\n",
    "- The duration increased from the 60s to the 70s, and then stayed at ~250s.\n",
    "- The songs become more and more energetic decade after decade.\n",
    "- The loudness also increases with the decades. The top songs seems to be louder as well.\n",
    "- The valence decreases with the time, and the top songs hang around 0.5 valence."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We can't really see any link between a feature through the years and the song hotness. We also can't, for most of the features, see any real evolution. These problems are maybe due to the selection bias of the MSD."
