"distri": "The analysis of the Electronic music cannot be done before the 90's as we don't have a lot of songs for older age. This probably due to the dataset in itself but also because Electonic has really becomes popular in the 90's(Wikipedia). Hottness of electronic music seems to follow the natural curve of the average hottness of the dataset's songs. Looking at accousticness it is interesting to notice that between 90's and 2000's it has increased, which could mean that electronic has evolved to become a bit less electronic than it was at its born.",
"Hottness": "We also oberve that Electronic music has a tendency to last longer than average song. Instrumentalness seems to be above the average value which is indeed not surprising, Electronic music is not famous for its textual content. However the result for speechiness are surprising as they does not seem concordant with the intrumentalness, looking deeper at the data we observe that speechiness seems to be completely biased(cf. rap analysis) and should probably not be trusted.
