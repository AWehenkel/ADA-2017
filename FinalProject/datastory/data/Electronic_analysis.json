"distri": "The analysis of the Electronic music cannot be done before the 90s as we don't have a lot of songs for the older years. This is probably due to the dataset in itself but also because Electronic has really become popular in the 90s(Wikipedia). The hotness of the electronic music seems to follow the natural curve of the average hotness of the dataset's songs. Looking at the acousticness it is interesting to notice that between the 90s and the 2000s it has increased, which could mean that electronic has evolved to become a bit less electronic than it was at its birth.",
"Hottness": "We also observe that Electronic music has a tendency to last longer than the average song. Instrumentalness seems to be above the average value which is indeed not surprising, as electronic music is not famous for its textual content. However the result for speechiness is surprising as it does not seem concordant with the intsrumentalness. Looking deeper in the data we observe that speechiness seems to be completely biased(cf. rap analysis) and should probably not be trusted. "
