"distri": "As for most of the songs present in the data set the rock of recent years is more represented than the older rock. It can be interpreted in two ways. First, assuming the dataset represents the reality, it would mean that rock music becomes more and more popular over the year. Another interpretation, more realistic, is that the data set regroups more recent music than older one. Indeed observing the global distribution of the song seems to go in the sense of the second conclusion"
,"Hottness": "As for most of the genre, the hottness of the songs increase with the year. Indeed hottness is a proxy for the number of listening of the song. However we can do an interesting observation in the 60's, we can see that rock music of these period seems to be more popular than other old rock songs."
