                    ''What makes a great song? It’s a big question, and one that has been written about endlessly in an attempt to unravel the “formula” for creating a world dominating smash hit record. Sure, there are some basic rules and if you were to examine a handful of the most successful or popular songs of the last four decades, they do have certain things in common. Intro, verse, bridge, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, middle 8, chorus, chorus etc springs to mind!''</p>

                In this project, we decided to investigate what it means to be a "good" song. With the help of the <a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">Million Song Dataset</a>, we looked into the various components of what is a song and what you could do to create a good song. As one can suppose, we were confronted with multiple issues as the problem isn't trivial. The whole problem is linked to everyone subjectivity, thus any results we get are debatable.
            </p>
            <!--p>
                We'll analyze a million songs metadata to extract what makes a song "hot", or "danceable". We'll look at different factors, like the loudness, the type of songs (tags), the duration, energy, tempo, etc. We'll also see which country produces the "best" songs, and what is the dominant type in each one. Moreover, we'll see if songs have changed a lot with the years, and if older songs are as appreciated as current ones. We'll obviously use the Million Song dataset for this. The main goal, in short is to learn more about music in general.

                The original dataset comes from the <a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/">Million Song Dataset</a> (aka MSD).

                Unfortunately, MSD lacks plenty of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, we totally lack the genre of each song. This is a problem, because as one can think, this or that property could have a huge impact following the genre (the loudness for electronic music, the tempo in Blues or Latin music, ...).
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we lack data that are supposed to be here. As you can see in the table to the left, energy and danceability are always at 0.0, which following the <a href="https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/pages/example-track-description">columns description</a> of MSD mean that the song isn't analyzed. However, it doesn't make sense to think that no song is analyzed (why add the column in this case). It specify that this attributs come from the Echo Nest API, but bad luck, this API is <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/spotify-echo-nest-api/">dead</a> since 2016.

                In fact, the Echo Nest API is dead because it was bought by spotify years ago, thus the Spotify API is the one replacing it. We were able to gather the missing features of MSD, and even more. By using get_feature, we were able to retrieve plenty new ones: accousticness, instrumentalness, valence, speechiness, ... (complete list <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-audio-features/">here</a>).

            <p>
                As a desperate attempt to complete the missing values for the year and the song_hotttnesss, we requested this datas too. Unfortunately, they werent accurate or better than the one already present, as they are linked to an album, usually not the first one to use this song. As for the genre, Spotify doesn't give genre for a song, but for the artist, which isn't relevant most of the time.

            <p>
                Let's start simple by going over a correlation between the feature. Obviously, we are interested in the first column, as its telling us if there are links between feature and the song_hotttnesss.
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't learn much from this graph at the first glance. We see a weak positive correlation with year, energy, loudness and a weak negative one with accousticness, valence. For the positive one, the loudness and energy correlations could be interpreted as people aren't fond of quiet song. The year correlation is related as how the song-hotttnesss is computed, as it decayed with time. The negative ones are linked to the comment about loudness/energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's note something about the definition of song_hotttnesss: it's a value that evolve with how popular is a song. Thus if we are in 2010, a song of 2010 has higher chance to have a higher song_hotttnesss than a song from 1970. This means that our work on the song_hotttnesss, if we achieve to show anything, will explain how to make a <b>popular</b> song, but not always a <b>good</b> one.

        <div class="container reveal_left col s6">
            <p>
                Again, mostly weak correlation here. Maybe we can say that it's better to be a Pop-Rock song to have a higher song_hotttnesss. However, as explained in a next section (<a href="#genre1">Genre Analysis</a>), the genre aren't uniformly distributed on the dataset and we lack plenty of them anyway (coverage of around a fourth of the dataset).
            </p>
            <p>
                Conclusion at this point, correlation only aren't enough to give any insight of how to make a popular song.

            <p>
                To move further in the analyze, we decided to apply a bagging regression to our dataset: a random forest regressor. This kind of regression allow us to get a feature importance on how to predict the song_hotttnesss of a song following every other feature we gathered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, we can't extract any useful insight again. Every feature (except maybe key), is equally important to predict the song_hotttnesss. Note however that it's a slightly different result from the previous correlation we made. This means we may have missed something, thus we will plot the distribution for every feature.

                First of all, it looks like the song_hotttnesss in general has a problem. We can see that song_hotttnesss never takes value in (0, 0.2). Either the dataset is highly biaised, or the way to compute the song_hotttnesss doesn't allow values in this range.

                <p>
                    The graph at the left represents the connection between the different genre of music. Each node represents a genre and its size represents the number of songs of this genre in the dataset. The link between nodes represents the songs which are considered to belong to both type of music. The thickness of the link represents the number of songs belonging to both type.</br>
                    This graph has been built to ease the vizualisation of the general overview of the genre distribution in the dataset. However on that we have also wanted to add something to allow the visitor to vizualize the different distribution of features conditionnaly to the genre.
                    </br>Indeed by <strong>Clicking</strong> on a node you can vizualize the distribution of some feature conditionnaly to this genre and some comment are made about noticeable facts.
                    </br><strong>Clicking</strong> on a link between 2 nodes allows you to compare the distributions of the features conditionnaly to each node genre.

                Most of the songs are not very acoustic today. The median acousticness seems to decrease with the years, especially after the 70s.
            </p>
            <p id="artist_hotttnesss_text" style="display:none;">
                Thankfully, we can see a correlation between the artist hotness and the song hotness. The distribution also seems to less centered around 0.5 in the recent years.
            </p>
            <p id="danceability_text" style="display:none;">
                We can't say much, except that it seems centered around 0.5.

            <p id="duration_text" style="display:none;">
                The median is around 250s. The best (and worst) songs are really close to this value, but their distribution is probably the same as with the other hotness values, it's just that there are fewer samples. We can see a jump from a ~200s center to the ~250s center after the 60s.
            </p>
            <p id="energy_text" style="display:none;">
                Same as with duration, we see a shift decade by decade, where the songs become more energetic.
            </p>
            <p id="instrumentalness_text" style="display:none;">
                Nothing much to say, except that the songs (at least the ones chosen by the MSD) were never instrumental.
            </p>
            <p id="liveness_text" style="display:none;">
                The distribution stays the same through the decades.

            <p id="loudness_text" style="display:none;">
                The songs get louder during the 90s and 00s. The top songs seem to be the the louder.
            </p>
            <p id="speechiness_text" style="display:none;">
                Same as instrumentalness, we can't say much.
            </p>
            <p id="tempo_text" style="display:none;">
                The tempo distribution stays the same throughout the years.

            <p id="valence_text" style="display:none;">
                The valence gets "worse" through the decades and the best songs stay around the 0.5 value.
